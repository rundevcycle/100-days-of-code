# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 31 October 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
  - Started challenge.
  - Start with Javascript ES6.

**Thoughts:** 
My work is focussed on server-side development or back-end batch processing.  Here's my goals for this challenge:
  - ES6+ for Javascript
  - Node.js
  - Front-end development with JS framework like React or Vue.js
  - Progressive web apps
  - Docker

### Day 1: 1 November 2018
  - Getting npm working with VS Code with JQuery Intellisense.
  - Capturing key presses with JS.  It's possible to get the function keys (except F7 in Firefox) to response and cancel their default behaviour, so F5 can be used as a shortcut in the page without refreshing.

### Day 2: 2 November 2018
  - Created a sample webpage that captures the function keys (F1-F12) and overrides their default browser behaviour.  They can be used to trigger events within the page.
  - Published to GitHub pages: https://rundevcycle.github.io/js-keymapper/app.html
